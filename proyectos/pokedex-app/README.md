This is a straightforward and user-friendly React application that interacts with the Pok√©mon API, enabling users to view, search, and filter Pok√©mon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

- **PokeList**: The central component fetching and storing Pok√©mon data from the API. It includes search, filter, and refresh functionalities.
  
- **PokeCard**: Renders each Pok√©mon in a card style, showing the image, name, and type. Clicking a card fetches detailed information about the Pok√©mon.
  
- **Details**: Displays comprehensive information about a selected Pok√©mon, such as attack, defense, abilities, height, and weight. It fetches detailed data using the Pok√©mon's ID.
  
- **Nav**: Renders the navigation bar, handling search terms and filters, then passing them to `PokeList` for filtering Pok√©mon.

- **Footer**: The footer component with link to my github.

## üîç How it Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The app uses React's `useEffect` to fetch data from the [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=120).

2. **Data Handling**: Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve data and then converts it to JSON. The data is stored in a state using the `useState` hook.

3. **Rendering Information**: Each Pok√©mon's ID, name, types, image, and stats are extracted and rendered.

4. **Search and Filter**: The app supports searching Pok√©mon based on user input, filtering the Pok√©mon list to match the search query.

5. **Detailed View**: Clicking a Pok√©mon card triggers a detailed fetch, revealing stats, height, weight, abilities, and more on a separate details page.
